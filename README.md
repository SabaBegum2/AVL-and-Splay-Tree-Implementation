# AVL-and-Splay-Tree-Implementation

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) Trees and Splay Trees in C++. The code demonstrates fundamental tree operations like insertion, deletion, in-order traversal, and key search. It serves as an educational tool for understanding the dynamics of self-balancing trees (AVL Trees) and Splay Trees in data structures.

Features:
AVL Tree Implementation: Includes methods for insertion, deletion, in-order traversal, finding minimum and maximum values, and checking for the presence of a key.
Splay Tree Implementation: Focuses on insertion and in-order traversal, showcasing the adaptive nature of Splay Trees.
Test Cases in Main: The main function provides a series of test cases for both tree types, including insertion of a predefined key set, in-order traversal outputs, and various tree operation demonstrations.
Efficient Data Handling: Both tree implementations offer efficient ways of handling data, with AVL Trees providing self-balancing capabilities and Splay Trees offering an adaptive structure based on access patterns.
Usage:
This code is ideal for educational purposes, providing a hands-on experience with advanced tree structures. Users can learn about tree balancing in AVL Trees and the self-adjusting nature of Splay Trees. It's also a great starting point for further experimentation and enhancement in tree-based data structures.

Contributing:
Contributions, suggestions, and enhancements are welcome to improve the implementation and expand the functionality of the trees.
